_I want to preface this post to all those who read it, that it is imperative that you make no assumptions._

_When we're young and inexperienced, you think of most things as being black and white. Relationships being one of them. My case in point: an affair. Most of you reading this probably think that there's a point of no return in your relationship if your significant other has a physical affair with someone. That's what I thought too, until I started to think about it more._

_I chose to write this because people don't think about these actions seriously enough. There needs to be more awareness of what's possible and the effect it has on people. It's synonmous with a death of a person... like a death of their spirit and happiness. That's really not okay._

### __The other side__

First, I want to introduce another type of affair that is rarely spoken about. You probably know what a physical affair entails -- and of course, it depends what an individual categorizes as physical affair -- but it could range from anything from holding hands, kissing, and sex. The one that is rarely spoken about is an emotional affair. Put simply, when an individual starts to confide in an individual outside of the relationship for emotional support, instead of confiding in their significant other. Now, I know that may seem a little grey, because then you would ask, "Well, what if I confide in my best friend for emotional support?". Point taken, because people should be allowed to have best friends and relationships outside of your significant other, but the trigger here is when you stop going to your significant other for emotional support and stop trying to communicate your needs and resolve your problems with your significant other. This may or may not lead to increasing sexual tension with the new party. Initially, it may not seem too bad, and may not be a dealbreaker. But here's to put it in perspective:

You started off your relationship by telling each other everything, from deaths and illnesses that have affected their life. You reciprocate because you believed that they were the one thing that would always be there for you, no matter how rocky the ride was. They were the first person you called whenever shit hit the fan. No one else saw your tears but them.

Fast forward to when the honeymoon ends, and another person enters their life. They stop telling you the problems they're having, and they no longer give you the time of day. You've raised this being an issue, but you also understand they're having a hard time at work so you decide to tough it out for them. Little do you know the late nights they come home from work are not because of work. Little do you know the reason why they're always on their phone is not because they're thinking of you. Little do you know two weeks ago, she was in his car and he leaned in...

How does it feel?

### __The one you hear about too often__

This really needs no explanation. But I want you to really feel this one too:

You let down all your walls for them. You didn't think that you could ever muster the courage to ask a them out, let alone try and kiss them. But they gave you the courage to because you really believe that you had something special. You fell in love with how they handled kids. Hearing their voice made everything okay. You gave them all your firsts. You gave them everything.

Three years later, when you thought everything was okay and she was careless, you found out she was living a life on the side. You saw in their conversation history that she spoke to him with the same intimacy that she spoke to you before. You found photos you weren't supposed to see.

The thoughts of betrayal overflow your mind and you start filling in the blanks. You imagine his skin on hers, you imagine his hands caressing her skin. You imagine them doing everything you used to do together. You imagine them waking up next to each other the next morning.

Let that also settle in.

### __Perspective__

I hope that puts into perspective how painful either or both situations could be for the victim and you have a better awareness of the challenges you could encounter when in a relationship. It's necessary to really feel how either situation could affect someone -- both for the person who's committing the act (or wandering into it) or the victim. More and more I'm finding it very rare for there to be brave people in the world. So before you decide to destroy someone's soul, please look at all the available options at hand. Talk it through; couples therapy really helps with this. If nothing helps, and you really can't see yourself with this person in the future, then be brave.

### __Creating Boundaries__

I hope when you first met each other and started hanging out, checking each other, being friends, and going on dates, you have come to realize if your partner's values align with yours with respect to relationship boundaries. Remember too that talk is cheap, and that here is where you have to take that giant leap of faith. You have to believe what they say is the truth, or you're signing yourself up for an avalanche of hurt. What are their tendencies? Are they telling me the truth? Eventually, you're going to need to trust this person to make decisions when you can't. Being able to trust another person to do this is no different than trust fall. When you're in a coma, or when you've passed away will they make the same decision that you would?

The reality is that even if you have this all figured out, there's still a chance things could turn sideways...

People change. When two engage in a monogamous relationship, there's two outcomes -- marriage, or break up. You align for one or the other. If you're in a serious relationship with the goal of marriage, it is so important that you grow together, instead of grow apart. You must recognize that when changes result in something more serious that deserves attention.

You must recognize when your needs change.

### __Balance__

Regardless of the boundaries that you establish in your relationship, know that love's foundation is built on trust, honesty, and loyalty. Be very careful of how you communicate your potential jealousy to your significant other. Over-reacting and being over-protective of actions that may bear no significance can cause feelings of being barred, but realize that you must also be honest with yourself and your feelings. If their actions are something that you can't deal with, you need to communicate that.

Worst of all, you don't want your significant other to feel like they're losing who they are. You don't want them to live in the fear of doing something wrong when they're just being who they are. Trust them with the freedom to do whatever they want, but be communicative about how those actions make you feel. You don't want to be the paranoid and over-protective significant other that pushes them away.

### __Taking responsibility__

Realize that the person who committed the act has their reasons for doing so. And although that person could provide the world of justification, make sure you protect yourself. Make sure they're not trying to manipulate you into thinking that you're the reason why it happened. You are always presented with choices that could lead you down one path of life or another. The choice they made there was not communicating their needs in the relationship and deciding to go somewhere else while they were still with you. Somewhere in their mind, they decided everything that your relationship went through to this point was worth the fling, the new relationship, or introducing the new party in the picture.

Being a part of a loving and caring relationship requires the maturity to understand the consequences of your actions, the thoughtfulness to understand the pain that is inflicted on your significant other, and the capacity to communicate your needs and embrace your differences.

People willingly and knowingly introduce risks in their life and know that if your significant other doesn't know where to draw the line, that's on them. Not you.

Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.

### __Kicking you while you're down__

A situation that could happen is the significant other deciding on continuing with this overlap. It will leave scars. Before you play the blame game, realize an infidelity requires two people to participate. If the homewrecker willingly engages and pursues your significant other while they know you're trying work things out with your significant other and your significant other is leaving the door open, they have both decided that the consequences are irrelevant to them. Going back to the point about immature and inconsiderate people, they're either not factoring in these consequences, or don't care about them. To be clear, what your partner did and qualifies as hurtful depends on your relationship, but what the other party did is even worse. It is the most cowardly and dishonest act that someone can do to another person. Think about this when you're considering whether or not you still want to be with the person. If you still care about your significant other, encourage them to think about what this person is capable of doing to them.

### __Flatlining__

It's not surprising when someone feels like the exciting aspect of their relationship is missing from back when they first met, which leads them to make rash decisions to see if the next relationship will provide them this missing feeling. Again, it probably will, but probably just for the first couple of months. Then they'll go through the same phases of a relationship again, and they'll find themselves in a new relationship pursuing that "newness". They think a relationship is defined by Valentine's Day, their anniversary, Christmas, engagement, marriage, or the vacations sprinkled throughout the relationship. Whereas a relationship is actually defined by your regular arbitrary day of the week. So they give up the man or woman who's right in front of them, treats them right, and is in it for forever for this false sense idea of "newness". These gems treat you consistently well, because they know what they want and don't need to fuck around.

### __Experiencing the bad to appreciate the good__

Sometimes people will use this reason to rationalize that they need to experience a really bad relationship to activate another dimension of themselves to truly appreciate a really good relationship. Time and time again I will say that there are other ways to learn what you don't want and need instead of getting yourself into a really bad situation for the better parts of your life. It almost feels as if they're looking for trouble...

I can't see how it is similar to applying a concept versus reading about a concept, but hopefully once they've experienced the bad, it isn't too late to get back the good.

### __Who do you want to struggle with?__

The reality is that every relationship is going to go through struggles. The question is not if you're going to have problems, disagreements, or fight. The question is how are you going to deal with them when they come your way. Your commitment to someone could span a lifetime, and you'll be encountering so many different situations together. You're kidding yourself if everything's going to be sunshine and rainbows. Who do you want to bicker with on who takes out the garbage? Who do you want to go through financial difficulties with? Who do you want to work on differences of opinion with? Will they fight for you like you'll fight for them? Will they love you like you're the last?

### __How much do you love her?__

Despite all that I've mentioned, I do believe there is a path forward from infidelity, as long as both parties are willing to work things through, together. If both parties are willing to put this behind them and heal together, this could just be one of the struggles a relationship has to go through. But if there's nothing to be learned from what happened, then you should take a step back and figure things out so you can grow from it as a person instead of moving on to the next thing.

### __Communication and the love that they need__

If this is all something you're trying to prevent, or has already happened to you, there was probably a slew of miscommunication that catalyzed this. To build awareness of each others' needs, I would highly recommend going through the Love Languages (https://www.5lovelanguages.com) and discussing this with your partner. Many people fail to realize that you need to love your partner in the way they need to be loved, not the way you want to be loved.

<br>

### __Recovery__

Don't begin doubting yourself. If you gave them everything, there's nothing else you can do. Keep your chin held high. You can't trust your significant other any less because that becomes toxic. You can only control what you do, and if they decide to engage in actions that hurt you, then you can't do anything about it.

You'll find someone else. You'll make someone else happy. You deserve it. You will rise again.

<br>

<br>

### __Thank you, next__

If you believe this is the point of no return, then I hope you can swallow your pride and thank them for everything, because at one point, they did give you everything and loved you more than anything.

If you choose to work things through, believe in love. Because there's nothing else that matters.

Thank you for reading, and thank you, for our little infinity.
